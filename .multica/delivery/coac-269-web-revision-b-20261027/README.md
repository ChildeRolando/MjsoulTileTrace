# COAC-269 — B line: ordinary-web targeted revisions

Ticket-local evidence bundle for the Multica ticket `COAC-269` (line B of the parallel editing split
authorised 2026-10-27T09:23Z). Shared code, the unified register, selection and pointers were not modified.

## Scope

- Line A (COAC-248) kept its in-flight and reserved chapters: 198/187/199/201, 215-4, 236, 283, PDF/metadata.
- Line B selected from the current `produced-needs-repair` ordinary-web chapters in
  `integration/coac250-unified-chapter-register-20261027b.json`, canonical chapterId descending,
  requiring an existing revision entry and a real parent `needs-repair` audit.
- Excluded in addition: terminal-passed chapters (174-1, 187-1, 198-1 at claim time), reserved numbers,
  metadata/cover rows, and `nemata-jp-chapter-347-1` whose parent audit has no `figureChecks`
  (the current revision guard rejects all 27 non-target figures).

## Chapters and results

Candidates live in the data root (not duplicated here):
`web-production/v1/candidates/modern-yabejp-ja/<article>.coac269rev1.json`.

- 338-1: `b0518` 「場の安さ高さ」 no longer rendered as 牌的疏密; the block now states the
  cheap/expensive board evaluation and keeps the pointer to the reading section.
- 273-1: `b0263` comparison object added; `b0545` 「七対シャンテン」 rendered as 七对子一向听.
  The independent reviewer should re-judge `b0263`: the produced wording is 「立直与本方案相比…」,
  not the prior audit's suggested 「与切[3m]」 construction; the prior audit is a locator, not truth.

## Calls (actual, no retries)

- Model `gpt-6.1-sol`, effort `high`; frozen runner `4a5ce8ab…`, CLI `3da98f5f…`, audit `8660208d…`
  (full `scripts/scene-study` snapshot copied into the ticket namespace before dispatch).
- 338-1: call `7b9806f0-3aed-4175-b454-b60a81abcd91`, 12,333 in / 315 out, 57.5 s,
  raw `raw-calls/7b9806f0-….json` SHA `338e534912caa6266cf01a6ed5fe86484eaba06a8ad7d6157fec2ab584a3d63b`.
- 273-1: call `2529e8f3-0b02-4c6c-ab05-3d24deaddb79`, 12,369 in / 813 out, 94.4 s,
  raw `raw-calls/2529e8f3-….json` SHA `5a41124fa320c736712ed6bd0b85585a730be5f379e46e03f2e8ce7a34d45444`.
- The first launcher attempt made **0** model calls (missing transitive import in a partial frozen copy);
  it is retained as `production-attempt0-rejected-frozen-runtime-incomplete.json`.
- Both calls were dispatched only after acquiring the existing single maker lane lock
  (`production-lane.lock`), wait 0 s, released on completion. No dual slot was invented, no lock deleted
  or bypassed, and no second maker call ran during the production windows — real concurrency stayed at 1 maker.

## Verification

- Zero-call preflight: source/parent/audit/dependency SHAs, target projection, faithful block and figure
  checks, dictionary coverage, no existing variant (`artifacts/preflight.json`).
- Deterministic self-check after production (not the independent audit): only the target text blocks differ,
  all other text blocks and all figures are byte-identical to the parent apart from render-only
  `presentationAsset`, flow order unchanged, raw artifact SHAs re-verified (`artifacts/selfcheck.json`).
- Independent first audit is **pending** with COAC-249 (`artifacts/handoff-249.json`). Nothing is claimed
  as passed. After 249 passes a candidate, COAC-250 is the single writer for integration.

## Namespace

Data artifacts: `E:/AgentData/Coach/knowledge/processing/web-production/v1/coac269-20261027/`
(`claims/`, `preflight/`, `receipts/`, `handoff/`, `frozen-runtime/`). This bundle copies the receipts and
scripts only; candidate and raw payloads stay in the data root referenced by SHA.
